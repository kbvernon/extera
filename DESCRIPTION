Description: The 'extera' package uses 'extendr' to provide access to the 'tera' 
    templating engine in Rust. Users mainly interact with an ExTera R6 object, 
    which serves as a template library with encapsulated methods for rendering 
    templates. To render a template, users supply a dataset known as a context,
    which consists of variable names and values. Template syntax supports 
    additional logic, including built-in filters, tests, and functions, as well 
    as loops, conditions, and inheritance. Documentation for tera's templating 
    syntax can be found at <https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/>.
