Description: Template engine powered by the 'tera' 'Rust' crate and
    'extendr'. Users mainly interact with an ExTera R6 object, which
    serves as a template library, including templates that depend on each
    other, a feature called in "inheritance" in tera. To render a
    template, users simply provide a context, or a dataset consisting of
    variable names and values. Template syntax supports additional logic,
    including built-in filters, tests, and functions, as well as loops,
    conditions, and inheritance. Documentation for tera can be found at
    <https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/>.
