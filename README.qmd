The name `extera` is a portmanteau of `extendr` and `tera`, making it suggestive
of the package's intended purpose, which is to provide an 
[`extendr`](https://github.com/extendr/extendr)-powered R wrapper around the 
blazing fast [`tera`](https://github.com/Keats/tera) templating-engine in Rust.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `extera` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("kbvernon/extera")
```

## Usage

To get a feel for what `extera` can do, let's start with a simple "hello world"
example.

```{r}
#| label: hello-world
library(extera)

tera <- ExTera$new()

tera$add_string_templates(
  "hello-world" = '<p>Hello {{ x }}. This is {{ y }}.</p>'
)

tera

tera$render_to_string(
  "hello-world",
  x = "world",
  y = "ExTera"
)
```

The syntax and API should look pretty familiar to anyone who has used `glue` to
do something like `glue::glue("Foo { x }", x = "bar")`. The big difference is
the object-oriented workflow. To learn more, check out the 
[Getting started](./articles/extera.html) article on the package website, or 
call `vignette("extera")`.
